<p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[7] is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters.[24] His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger.[25] He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[26]

Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon,[27] the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[28] the sworn brother of late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He is one of the few people in the world that carry the Will of D.

Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors in the Grand Line; emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters and even the World Government.[29] Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press has labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", though many prominent figures consider this to be exaggerated</p></section> <section id="contact">
